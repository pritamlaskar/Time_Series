# Time_Series
Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed
values. A time series is a series of data points indexed or listed or graphed in time order. Forecasting involves taking models fit on historical data and using them to predict future observations. The purpose of time series analysis is generally two fold to understand or model the stochastic mechanisms that gives rise to an observed series and to predict or forecast the future values of a series
based on the history of that series. </br>

My repository contains projects that involve forecasting of time-series. Some are: </br> </br>
***TimeSeries_TractorSales***: We predict sales of John Deere tractors using ARIMA and SARIMA. Libraries used include basic EDA libraries like pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib and stats libraries like statsmodels.api, statsmodels.graphics.tsa and statsmodels.metrics.
